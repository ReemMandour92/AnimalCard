        Seagulls are seabirds with general colors of white or grey, often with black markings on the head and/or wings. They have a strong body, hooked bill, long legs with fully webbed feet. They are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of food, including fish, marine, and freshwater invertebrates. Seagulls can drink either freshwater or saltwater, though they prefer freshwater. They have supratropical glands(also called nasal or salt glands) which remove sodium chloride from the bloodstream. They prefer to sleep on a calm body of water but will sleep in any wide-open spot- <a href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/photos/nation/Flight-of-fancy-Why-there-are-more-seagulls-in-the-UAE-now--1#slide9" target= "_blank">Article</a>.
